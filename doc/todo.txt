Tags
  - tag groups - if certain set of tags occurs together, merge it into a single tag

- generate UID for internal articles and make it non-null and unique
- integrate embeddings into AI log? (we at least need to monitor costs)

Ingestion

- define filter texts and elements on article source level
- split ingestion to url gathering and body download so body can be only downloaded when article is updated
- add option to not download body and only keep summary (NYT)
- mimic normal traffic
  - define min delay on article source to prevent error 429
  - define max articles per minute and download new articles first
- subscribe to newsletters and then import articles
- detect if body is damaged (e.g. there is only video or image)
